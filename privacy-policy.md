# Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 29, 2026

## Overview

Era is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your photos never leave your device. We don't collect, transmit, or store any personal data.

## Data Storage

All photos and data are stored locally on your device using iOS's file system and SQLite database. Nothing is uploaded to external servers or cloud services.

## Permissions

Era requests the following permissions:

- **Camera:** Required to capture daily selfies with face detection.
- **Photo Library:** Required to save generated timelapse videos to your camera roll.
- **Notifications:** Optional. Used only for daily reminder notifications at your chosen time.

## Face Detection

Face detection happens entirely on your device using Apple's built-in frameworks. Face data (eye positions for alignment) is stored locally alongside your photos and never transmitted anywhere.

## No Account Required

Era doesn't require or support user accounts. There's no registration, no login, and no personal information collected.

## No Analytics or Tracking

We don't use analytics, advertising, or tracking of any kind. We don't know who you are or how you use the app.

## Third-Party Services

Era doesn't integrate with any third-party services or share data with external parties.

## In-App Purchases

If you make in-app purchases, those transactions are handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We don't process or store payment information.

## Data Deletion

You can delete individual photos within the app, or delete all data by uninstalling the app from your device. Since everything is stored locally, uninstalling removes all traces of your data.

## Children's Privacy

Era doesn't knowingly collect data from anyone, including children. Since all data stays on your device, there's no collection to speak of.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we'll update the "Last updated" date and notify users through an app update.
