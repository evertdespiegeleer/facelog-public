    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 29, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Era is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your photos never leave your device. We don't collect,
        transmit, or store any personal data.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All photos and data are stored locally on your device using iOS's file system and SQLite database. Nothing is
        uploaded to external servers or cloud services.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>Era requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Required to capture daily selfies with face detection.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> Required to save generated timelapse videos to your camera roll.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Optional. Used only for daily reminder notifications at your chosen time.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Face Detection</h2>
    <p>Face detection happens entirely on your device using Apple's built-in frameworks. Face data (eye positions for
        alignment) is stored locally alongside your photos and never transmitted anywhere.</p>

    <h2>No Account Required</h2>
    <p>Era doesn't require or support user accounts. There's no registration, no login, and no personal information
        collected.</p>

    <h2>No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
    <p>We don't use analytics, advertising, or tracking of any kind. We don't know who you are or how you use the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Era doesn't integrate with any third-party services or share data with external parties.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>If you make in-app purchases, those transactions are handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We don't
        process or store payment information.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete individual photos within the app, or delete all data by uninstalling the app from your device.
        Since everything is stored locally, uninstalling removes all traces of your data.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Era doesn't knowingly collect data from anyone, including children. Since all data stays on your device, there's
        no collection to speak of.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we make changes to this privacy policy, we'll update the "Last updated" date and notify users through an app
        update.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can contact us at: [your email address]</p>
